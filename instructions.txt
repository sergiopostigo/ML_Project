Install dependencies:

If using pipenv:
    pipenv install
Otherwise:
    pip install requirements.txt

Run the jupyter notebooks. They are meant to be run in the following order, since they may have dependencies:
    ./scripts/data_analysis.ipynb
    ./scripts/data_cleaning.ipynb
    ./scripts/data_preprocessing.ipynb
    ./scripts/models.ipynb

If running from a cloned repo, make sure the following folders are created before run to avoid any error:
    ./data
    ./data/raw_data
    ./data/cleaned_data
    ./data/preprocessed_data
